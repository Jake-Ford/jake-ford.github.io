Previously, I’ve worked in policy\nanalysis and transportation modeling at the state and local government\nlevel.\n\nMy interests include travel, food, their very important combination\nin addition to writing about policy related questions in a data science\nframework; along with books I’m reading, podcasts I’m listening to,\nNIMBY attempts to Jim Crow-ify their gains in capital investments.\nSometimes it’s fun, sometime’s it’s serious, hopefully more often than\nnot it’s both!\nHere’s charlie, our rescue greyhound. You’ll probably be seeing him a\nlot here. Look at that snoot.\n\n\n\n\n",

Through a grant, I spent several months\ninvestigating the degree of bias existing in the algorithm, conducting a\nlarge literature review to identify leading quantitative measures of\nbias and fairness in ML. Results, along with a more context + lit review\ncan be found here.\nAlso at Solstice, we conducted a multi-tiered analysis of community\nsolar prioritization and barriers to LMI access. Funding was provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO).\nThis research looked at potential consumers, developers and financiers,\nand real performing solar farms. The data analysis and github page with\nmore details and results are available here;\ncurrently a white paper is being drafted with co-authors Zahra Thani and\nLiz Neyens. Once available, I will link here.\n\n\n\n",
