Previously, I’ve worked in policy analysis and transportation modeling at the state and local government level.\n\n\n\nMy interests include travel, food, their very important combination in addition to writing about policy related questions in a data science framework; along with books I’m reading, podcasts I’m listening to, how NIMBY-ism stifles progress and innovation. Sometimes it’s fun, sometimes it’s serious, hopefully more often than not it’s both!\nHere’s charlie, our rescue greyhound. You’ll probably be seeing him a lot here. Look at that snoot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It worked for me, hopefully it works for others, but just remember everyone’s background experience is different, so what worked for someone may not work for another :)\nCoursera\nIntro to DS in Python\nIntro to DS in R\nR Programming\nData Science Toolkit (Theory, some application)\nDevOps/MLOps\nChicago DS MLOps\nFlask and Docker Deploy 101\nPDF/Books\nOk lot coming here, do you need to to look at any of these besides maybe the first one? probably not; but you can keep these links saved in case in the future you want to dive deeper or you need a refresher.\nThe Saints of Data Science resources, Jimmy Oty and Lawrence Juma put up this amazing repo of pdfs of leading books and resources for Data Science and other topics.\nISLR - this is the bible of data science, if you’re going to read one book, read this one. It’s available for free, for either Python or R versions. Section 5.1 on CV is good review as well to refer to if needed.\nCV done Wrong - good, quick read on CV, a good refresher if you’re rusty.\nBuild a Career in Data Science I loved this book when i was searching for DS jobs - also does a great job explaining how a data analyst vs data engineer vs data scientist sometimes differ and sometimes really don’t, but a great resource all together. Also available for free via Jimmy Oty.\nPython Machine Learning - a brick of a book but an absolute gem, one i keep on hand at my desk and probably the one i still reference. easiest one to follow along with on the concepts - written by Sebasitan Raschka.\nR Programming for DS - self explanatory, if you wanna dive into R\nAdvanced R - note in the intro, authors put a ‘recommended reading’ list that can really be the starting point to the black hole of references. Black hole may be a bit strong, but a lot of the really good, widely available and free online pdfs reference each other, you’ll start to notice after a bit in the field.\nLantz ML in R - one of my favorite ML references, super good review of the basic concepts and really straightforward code to replicate on your own, best way to learn is to do!\nfrom R to Python - github page FULL of references for for Python newbies, with a focus on those who have some R foundation. You’ll notice A LOT of people who don’t have a BS in Computer Science prefer R over Python - it is often easier to ‘muscle’ through code, there are fewer instances of object oriented work and i think it has a smaller learning curve.\nVanderPlas’s Python Data Science Handbook - very solid starting point for using Python in DS work, with code repos to follow along with exercises. The basics (lists, data frames, pandas, numpy, loops/while/conditionals) are great starting point\nNg’s Machine Learning Yearning - Andrew Ng is the ‘father of AI/ML’ out of Standford, he’ll probably win a nobel one day\nJob Boards\nInternship specific: aijobs.net, datajobs, outerjoin - remote focused.\nTech Jobs For Good - Awesome site for mission based tech jobs, varies from part time to full time exec level positions.\nBen Green’s Job List- fantastic job lists - check out his hyperlinks, focus on Data Science in social good sectors, but good starting point\nBlogs/Others\nTowards Data Science - this is likely my favorite source, they send daily emails of data science topics that are very digestible but also very tailored (VS Code vs Jupyter Lab pros/cons, Random Forest vs XGBoost, etc) -\nYouyang Gu - blog did some absolutely amazing covid modeling during the pandemic, excellent writer as well\nAnna-Lena Popkes - Fantastic python walkthrough of ML concepts, very easy to follow along\nAlexis Perrier - bit too academic-y for my tastes, but posts good amount more than others so i keep an eye on it\nMarginal Revolution - not data science specific, but a great blog for economics, non-US focused pieces you wouldn’t see in leading news outlets, and a smattering of cultural pieces; Tyler Cowen is as idiosyncratic as they come, and has a fantastic podcast as well. I’m not a Libertarian, but I appreciate TC’s perspective and willingness to engage others across fields and ideologies.\n\n\n\n",

Through generous support from the Tides Foundation and Google, I spent several months investigating the degree of bias existing in the algorithm, conducting a large literature review to identify leading quantitative measures of bias and fairness in ML. The pre-print version of the paper, Fairness in Focus: Quantitative Insights into Bias within Machine Learning Risk Evaluations and Established Credit Models and accompanying repository can be viewed here.\n\nGoogle.org, the nonprofit philanthropic arm of the tech giant, doubled down on their support of EnergyScore by providing a grant to Solstice to fully develop the ML product while utilizing the same bias metrics and ethical AI principles I developed in the initial research linked above. We’ve collected an updated dataset of over 30 million account level data to make the model applicable in a variety of renewable energy financing scenarios. The model is currently in development and will be deployed in the coming months with a pilot partner.\nSolstice and Google Partner to Advance Inclusive Clean Energy Access\nChurn Model\nAt Solstice, we developed a churn model to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the platform. I was responsible for the data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building. The model was built using a few different model combinations, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. The model was able to predict churn with an AUC > 0.95. The model was deployed in production and is used to identify customers at risk of leaving the platform. You can read more about this model and other AI/ML projects at Solstice at the following press links:\nCan AI help community solar projects hold onto their customers? Canary Media\nCommunity solar developers look to artificial intelligence to help manage subscribers and advance equity, Energy News Network\nInside community solar’s foray into machine learning, Latitude Media\nSETO\nAlso at Solstice, we conducted a multi-tiered analysis of community solar prioritization and barriers to LMI access. Funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). This research looked at potential consumers, developers and financiers, and real performing solar farms. The data analysis and github page with more details and results are available here; read our paper here where I was corresponding author.\n\n\n\n",
