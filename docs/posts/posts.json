    "contents": "\nHere are a running list of observations I’ve made since moving to Canada from the US in the summer of 2023. I’ve been living in Toronto, so my observations are mainly focused on Ontario related topics. I’ll update this list as I continue to live here.\nHealthcare: The healthcare system in Canada is great. I’ve had to visit the doctor a few times since moving here and it’s been a breeze. No insurance forms, no copays, just show your health card and you’re good to go. Overall, 10/10; there are some issues with wait times that get a disproportionate weight of coverage in the media, but IMO it’s been very easy to navigate. We also had a baby in this country, and that process relatively simple and we didn’t pay a dime for anything, repeat, anything.\nin fact, most Canadians we talk to re: childbirth were aghast at the notion of ‘paying’ for childbirth; it’s a foreign concept to them.\nCustomer service in general in Toronto is of a different nature here compared to the US, and this I think goes beyond healthcare. In the US, you can call your doctor’s office, sometimes speak directly to the doctor, and get an appointment within a few hours. In Toronto, there is a process for everything, you get in queue and wait your turn. It’ll be free, but you wait your turn. This can often be frustrating, but it’s a trade-off for the free healthcare.\n\nWeather: The weather isn’t ideal, let’s be real. The winters are long and cold, but the summers are beautiful and the city seizes hold of each long day of sunshine; restaurants and bars expand their seating almost daringly into the street, parks are filled with people who are allowed like trusting adults to drink in public by the government, and there are weekly festivals and events to bop in and out of.\nCost of Living: The cost of living in Toronto is high, especially when it comes to housing. Rent prices are expensive and buying a house is out of reach for many people.\nSafety: Yeah it’s a lot safer than the US, this can’t be avoided. I’ve never felt unsafe walking around the city, even at night. There are big city issues like any place in the world, but with a modicum of awareness, you’re fine.\nPublic Transportation: The public transportation system in Toronto, from a US perspective, is great. We have a car, but it largely sits static in the parking garage. We rely on the TTC to get around the city. The subway and streetcars are reliable and run frequently. I’ve also been impressed with the cleanliness of the system.\nas alluded, most Torontonians are very critical of the TTC: it does have its issues, namely that the subway line has very limited spread, and the streetcars are slow and often delayed. But, it’s still a great system compared to any major US city. However, on the flip side, given it’s larger than Chicago, Boston or DC, Toronto subway system in particular has plenty of room to grow. The aptly named Ontario Line is under construction to drastically improve upon this issue; but likely won’t be running until the start of the 2030s.\n\nFood: The food scene in Toronto is amazing. There are so many great restaurants to choose from. I’ve also been impressed with the quality of the produce and meat available at the grocery stores; especially from the little mom-pop style specialty stores. Read more on my favorite food spots and dishes not to miss here on the Great Toronto Food Map\nPeople & Politics: Generally, the people in Toronto are friendly and welcoming. I’ve made some great friends since moving here and have felt very much at home. I love the diversity of the city, there are people from all over the world living here.\nAs a 30 something, making new friends in a new city with no connections can be a bit daunting, but one piece of advice: get involved in a weekly ‘thing’: a club, group, or class. We got involved in a weekly, not-so-intense run club that met a brewery, and it was a great way to meet people who shared a love of running + beer!\nCanadians love to talk about US politics, perhaps in a shadenfreude manner. It’s understandable given recent idiotic trade war discussions, but even before the 2024 election, Canadian news outlets largely covered US politics. As an effect, it was somewhat difficult to understand the political landscape of Canada, as it was largely overshadowed by US politics.\nCanadian MPs, in what I imagine is a British legacy, make themselves available to constituents via their public offices almost daily. This is very different from the US system, where members of Congress or local legislatures often don’t bother with the effort. When I mentioned this fact to a few Canadians, that many Americans likely wouldn’t recognize or be able to access their elected official if they wanted to, pearls were clutched and gasps were, um, gasped.\n\n\n\n\n",

When a group plays the sleeper jams that only true blue acolytes would know the name of, that’s instantly revealed by looking at the set list data. I wanted to combine this interest by looking into the well-researched world of Taylor Swift analysis. The Era’s tour concluded a few months back, setting global records for revenue generated. I wouldn’t consider myself a Swiftie, but I do appreciate the shear volume of songs TayTay has at her disposal to fill her setlists for like 4 years straight of sold out concerts or however long the Era’s tour was.\nThe table view is just a simplified view of the Swiftipedia Surprise Song tracker data. What songs were only played in certain countries or cities, was the question I wanted to pursue with this quick analysis. Honestly, I can’t believe Picture to Burn was only played one time, in Denver! Today was a Fairytale, only twice, in Warsaw and Houston.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency Analysis\nThe below plotly graph goes into a bit more details, showing the frequency of songs played over time. The dropdown menu allows for filtering by song title. The data is aggregated by month and year, and the plot shows the frequency of each song played in different locations. This view allows for a more interactive exploration of the data, with the ability to focus on specific songs and their distribution over time. If a song was only played once in a specific location, it will show up as a single point on the graph. For example, London Boy was only played one time, in an unsurprising location!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a Song Title:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nTransit Time\nI was recently in Europe (Paris - Salzburg - Munich - Porto - Lisbon). Of course the food, the drinks, the sights and the people (especially Portugese, which absolutely rank among the top 5 friendliest people I’ve ever met) were all amazing. But as a recovering Transportation Modeler for a mid-size Southern US city, I couldn’t help but be awed by the transit systems. The German system in particular was stereotypical efficient, but the Paris Metro was also a marvel. There’s been an immense quantity of literature and thinking on why the US transit system falls behind in comparison, both from a purposeful funding decisions and a ridership perspective. But this misses something that maybe you only experience when you travel that must be a prerequeiste to successful transit networks: density.\nIf you’ve read the Three Body Problem series (spoiler incoming) at one point, the entire earth population shifts to Australia. With billions of people located in the one continent, the population density of this new land resembled current day + alien free Japan. This fact was rather shocking, but perhaps this told me more about Japan than the alien takeover. Japan is ten times more dense than the US, 873 people per square mile, compared to the US’s 87. England is 8x more dense than the US.\nLet us look at a quick visual comaprison of the Eastern US seaboard, which is the most dense part of the US, and Western-Central Europe. For population density, I use this handy dandy webiste; and Open Railway Map for transit lines. Is this scientific? Is it even to scale to proplerly compare? Are we unneccessarily and naively applying AI or ML to this? No. No. No. That’s not the point. The point is to show that the US is not only not as dense, but critically, it does not have the necessary dense chain of potential stops. The Eno Center of Transportation post on this very subject in 2019 puts it succintly: “For fixed-guideway mass transportation (whether by railroad, or subway/elevated rail, or bus rapid transit), there’s just no substitute for population density as a measure of the need for, and likely success of, the system.” and that density matters for transit.\nThe US Case\nUS DensityUS TransitThe European Case\nEuropean DensityEuropean TransitConclusion\nI love dreaming of hypothetical transit networks across North America as much as the next ex-Transportation Modeler; but at some point the reality of the situation must be faced. The US is not dense enough to support the kind of transit networks that are seen in Europe. This is not to say that the US should not invest in transit, but that the US should be realistic about what kind of transit networks it can support without, ahem, changes in how cities are planned to encouerage sustainable densification.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBiking to Airports, it’s great!\nFor those of you who aren’t aware, Toronto has two airports: Pearson, a huge, international hub that is 25 minute express train from downtown; and a smaller, more regionally focused ‘City of Toronto’ airport called Billy Bishop. Billy-B, as no one I’m aware calls it, is located right off the waterfront in the middle of the city; you could probably hit the CN Tower with a 7 iron. It must be the most urban-located airport in North America, unless I’m missing some evil villain’s secret jet strip in Queens.\n\nA major benefit of this type of locale for an airport is that it allows faithful customers to use multiple means of transit. I used to work in Transportation Planning in the Triangle area in North Carolina. The Raleigh-Durham (RDU) airport sits right in between, well, Raleigh and Durham (Chapel Hill you exist too, I didn’t forget). BUT, there is no easy transit (or bike lanes) from either city to the airport; even the bus lines are convoluted and push environmentally or budget minded customers to car-share or park-n-ride or whatever the hell a kiss-n-ride is. Not having transit lines extend to airport access for major cities is insane but also tremendously difficult to accomplish in the U.S. due to the way transit is funded and the lack of political will to make it happen at times, but also because of the way cities are designed.\nSo after we moved to Toronto, I had my eyes on the day I would finally fly out of Silly Billy Airport, as we live close enough that I could hop on a city bike, and cruise over! The ride over, in short, was glorious. The views from the Billy Bishop airport are also fantastic, the waiting area, for all three or so gates available, felt more like a nicer university than I went to library.\nThe trip over prompted some questions: is Billy Bishop the most accessible via bike compared to other major US and Canadian airports. My completely impartial and non-competitive hypothesis is that it offers access via bike to the greatest number of people, both in absolute and relative terms to the city’s population. To answer this, I started pulling isochrone (more on this below) and census data. For this analysis, I’m using mb_isochrone function from the mapboxapi package, very user friendly and effective. Their ‘profile’ methods of transportation include driving, walking, cycling, and driving in traffic. A transit map would require different packages, but would be a good follow up to this!\nThe Competitors\nFrom the American Delegation:\nJFK\nLAX\nO’Hare\nDC Reagan\nATL\nSFO\nDallas Fort Worth\nPHL\nSeattle\nDenver\nCharlotte\nOrlando\nFrom the Canadian Delegation:\nToronto Pearson\nSilly Billy\nMontreal\nVancouver\nIsochrone Madness\nTransportation Modeling 101: Isochrones: a travel distance map, taking into account existing networks. Usually measured in time, it uses aggregated and average travel distance (sometimes by time of day, AM vs PM) to plot out how far one could travel from a given point. These ink-blot looking items on the below map represent a 60 minute isochrone from each of the major airports we consider. You may have to zoom in to see these. For example, if you’ve been to the Denver airport, you may have asked yourself: “why did they build this airport in Kansas?” Then the shape of the isochrone may not be entirely surprising, given the airport’s location. Alternatively, DCA looks a bit more intuitive, given it is amazingly close to downtown DC.\nFor the analysis below, we’ll consider isochrones at 30, 45, and 60 minute intervals, meaning we’ll look at how far on average one could bike from the airport in 30, 45, or 60 minutes.\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll notice is that most airports are placed relatively far from the city they serve. This is sensible given the space these facilities require for safe operations and storage. The below graph shows the total area covered by each of the three isochrone sets. At first, it seems my hypothesis is ruined; not only is Silly Billy among the lowest in total area covered, but it’s not even better than Pearson (which doesn’t exactly make sense if you live here). Atlanta’s and DFA cover the most amount of area at the 60 minute mark, which may be true, but I’ve spent very little time at those airports and didn’t particularly notice a lot of bikers. The scaries are starting to set in for my hypothesis.\nHowever, it does track that Denver’s airport is the lowest, given it is located approximately 15 light years from downtown Denver and likely does not have bike lanes to/fro that many people would be able to take.\n\n\n\nShow me the People\nWho cares about area coverage? Well you should have, but not anymore! Let’s translate those isochrones into how many people are covered within those areas. We’ll use public US and Canadian census data to overlay loaded tracts with populations, then do a simple geospatial overlay to translate how many people are within the isochrone. This will show:\nHow many people are able to bike to airports in a given X minute interval\nGive a better comparison metric between airports that take into account the concentration and distribution of actual humans, instead of area.\nThe results are below: For the 60 minute definition, Silly Billy is not number 1… but it’s number 2! JFK leads the way, which fine, whatever, likely makes sense there are 4x as many people in NYC than Toronto. BUT! I will claim a modicum of vindication given over 500k people live within a 30 minute bike ride to Silly Billy, and over 1.5 million live within an hour bike ride.\nHowever, under the 45 and 30 minute definitions, the Billy Bishop airport is the most accessible by bike in to the greatest number of people of all the airports considered. This suggests that a significant number of people live within that 45 max biking isochrone of Billy Bishop, representing the dense Toronto downtown core, but when compared to JFK, the 60 minute isochrone is able to pull in more people given the sheer size of NYC. It seems like for those of us who are not donning their speedo like cycling jerseys and biking up to an hour with luggage but are rather willing to bike up to 30-45 miinutes to to get to the airport, Silly Billy is the best option.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nBiking to the airport is freeing, gets your body loose before you’re crammed into an aisle seat, is a carbon-free means of transit, is significantly cheaper than car-sharing or parking fees, and is overall awesome! If you ever get the chance to do it, do it!\n\n\n\n\n",

He won’t have this for long, as he soon be surpassed by other superstars including another Celtic player. Nonetheless, the numbers involved have been staggering to say the least. A five year, $303.7 million dollar extension. Thats an average of $60 million dollars per year.\nSalary Cap Increase\nFor the upcoming 2024 Fiscal Year NBA season, the salary cap is $136 million dollars. The new TV deals and whatever other shenanigans they’re doing (including a lot of amazing and not-so amazing work to globalize the NBA) results in the salary cap skyrocketing in the next ten years.\n\n\n\nBig Jumps\nThe below graph shows the annual percent change in the cap. Much has been written about the 2016 spike allowing some over powered dynasties to carry on their demonination a bit longer. But thats not even the highest spike in the last three decades; what the hell happaned in 1995-96? That’s for another day…\n\n\n\nThe Brown Case\nLets look at the top 21 salaries in the NBA over the next couple years.

But after that, and critically before any mega-blooper deals are paid to Giannis, Luka, and Embiid, he’ll be in the top 5 or 3.\nShould Boston fans temporarily pause in their self flaggelation over their wittling salary cap? Maybe. Or maybe it helps to just remember that while they will be attributing ~40% of their cap to Jaylen Brown for the rest of the 2020s, whoever trades for Damian Lillard and the Phoneix Suns are doing the same with Bradley Beal. Given the age difference I’d much rather be Boston.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nTakeaways from this captivating country:\nFood tours: My wife organized a food tour through a few of\nSeoul’s many food markets for my birthday. A food tour remains the\nsingle most efficient use of condensed time to ‘see’ a city.\nBusan - something about the dichotomy between ocean and this\nmassive city skyline is surreal. I met my wife during the closing days\nof the 7th International Marine Debris Conference, so had a half day to\nmyself. The tried and true method of ordering food by pointing at\nanother person’s dish + thumbs up was further proved effective. Loved\nBusan, seemed to be a great jumping off point to other interesting areas\nalong the southern coast as well - Jeju being the most popular\nperhaps?\nSeoul’s National Museum of Korea is 1) housed in a massive and\ngorgeous building 2) would require better part of a full day to fully\nview, though can be sufficiently sifted through in a wondrous stupor\nwithin 4 hours and 3) is free! 10/10 recommend.\nGyeongju - from the population, it was much more domestic\ntravelers than international, which makes sense given the main\nattractions of Bulguksa and Seokguram Grotto, both classified as\nnational treasures. Walking through the parks in Gyeongju with the\nancient burrial mounds dotted throughout was amazing, very different\nthan the cityscapes of Seoul and Busan!\nThe distinct culture built over centuries of international\ninterference from Tang -> Mongols -> Chinese -> Japanese ->\nUnited States (apologies if that order leaves out any particular party)\nis absolutely unique to any country I’ve been to previously. For\nexample, at Bulguksa, the temple itself was destroyed by invading\nforces, and much of the scene today was rebuilt in modern times to\nancient specifications. At Seokguram Grotto, the 8th century masonry\nstill survives. At both locations, an equal level of intense pride was\nevident from Koreans. Their people are resilient and, rightfully, damn\nproud of the metropolitan wonder they have built while holding on to\ntheir history that goes back some five or six millennia.\nTransportation, ok lets talk about it. South Korea is roughly the\nsize of the state of Indiana, and it’s transportation system was nothing\nshort of stunning, efficient, fast and clean. Every metro stop had\nperfectly usable bathrooms - could you imagine this in the States! For\nall metros and buses, a single loadable card can be used across systems.\nThis part in particular blew my mind, what a convenient payment method\nfor users. I couldn’t imagine Los Angeles and San Francisco agreeing to\na unified name of a transportation system let alone a unified payment\nmethod.\nDrinking - every drink we had was based around a meal, which was\nsuch a slight but profound shift. Every night was a bit of a banger in\nour section of town, near Jonggak station in Seoul - which may be a\nfunction of the area - but sipping on soju or Korean beers over a spicy\nmeal is quite lovely :)\nStay young y’all :)\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nVapid & Plastic\nTake a stroll down any street in my neighborhood in Durham, which many on this blog have called the Mecca of the South, and you’ll quickly notice the tell-tale sign that you’re in a quickly gentrifying, liberal leaning area: the lawn signs.\nBlack lives matter. Science is Real. Housing is a Human Right. Stop the Steal. (Just kidding about that last one)\nThese signs are sometimes critisized as virtue signaling But I’m not here to argue about lawn signs. I do believe that in the broad, middle to upper-middle class Democratic base there is a pervasive hypocrisy when it comes to political priorities espoused (often via lawn ornamentation) and the actions that defend and hoard opportunities for others. I was lucky to take a seminar from Richard Reeves of the Brooking Institute on the very subject, and he’s written prodigiously regarding this very confluence of virtue signaling and policy setting. These double-standards are nearly as ubiquitous as the aforementioned lawn signs: university legacy admissions, fiscal policy such as the mortgage interest deduction, 529 plans, estate and sales tax and most recently the absurd SALT deduction - which Reeves argues should be completely eliminated, and house zoning.\nI found myself wondering, are Durham zoning laws reflective of a majority Democratic enclave, a quickly growing liberal bubble? Are we, like many other cities in America, zoned predominately for single-family households? And above all, are Durham’s zoning ordinances aligned with beliefs of all those stupid lawn signs?\nNote: Durham’s Comprehensive Plan is being updated, so zoning ordinances are likely to occur.\nEDA\nI wish I could take a time machine back to a younger Jake, complaining about a problem set in his graduate quant class. Oh, is that perfectly cleaned data set provided by the professor annoying to load into your program? Is the codebook too succint? I wouldn’t hit this Jake, violence is never the answer, but I would shake him a bit.\nThe question we’re trying to answer is to what degree is Durham’s zoning amenable to non-single family homes? Using 2020 census data, we can determine the percentage of Durham-ites zoned for single or multiple family homes. Growth in households and population will be measured based on where that growth is occuring by zone type. First, we need the zone type.\nZone Types\nDurham’s zoning data is publicly available, and is classified in an understandably long-winded manner. Below are the initial zone types:\n\n\n                     COMMECIAL                     COMMERCIAL \n                             1                            520 \n            COMMERCIAL GENERAL              COMMERCIAL INFILL \n                             3                              2 \n             COMMERCIAL_INFILL        COMMERCIAL_NEIGHBORHOOD \n                             1                              1 \n           COMPACT DESIGN-CORE COMPACT DESIGN-PEDESTRIAN BUS. \n                             2                              1 \n      COMPACT DESIGN-SUPPORT 1       COMPACT DESIGN-SUPPORT 2 \n                             1                              2 \n       COMPACT SUBURBAN DESIGN           DOWNTOWN DESIGN-CORE \n                             4                              2 \n     DOWNTOWN DESIGN-SUPPORT 1      DOWNTOWN DESIGN-SUPPORT 2 \n                             5                              8 \n                    INDUSTIRAL                     INDUSTRIAL \n                             2                            174 \n                     MIXED USE                      MIXED_USE \n                             1                             15 \n          OFFICE_INSTITUTIONAL               RES_HIGH_DENSITY \n                           247                            419 \n               RES_LOW_DENSITY             RES_MEDIUM_DENSITY \n                           447                            166 \n             RES_RURAL_DENSITY                       RESEARCH \n                           177                             13 \n             RURAL RESIDENTIAL           UNIVERSITY COLLEGE-2 \n                             1                              2 \n\nAs the songbird of our generation Carly Rae Jepson once said, let’s cut to the feeling.\nLet’s collapse each zone into broad buckets: residential, commercial, university, downtown and compact. The last two will be treated nearly identically. Compact is a newer designed zone theorized to increase density, multimodal traffic like transit and bike lanes, and allow access to work and play in and around Durham.\nThe below table from the previous Durham Comprehensive Plan shows the below table, which we will use to approximate dwell units permitted on each type of zone. Downtown zones in the ‘High’ Density have a hilarious “unlimited” density limit, so I’m expecting a new Burj Khalifa sooner rather than later with that type of free reign. Note, I will use the median value of the density ranges, but it doesn’t matter too much, as you’ll see.\n\nAfter collapsing, we get the following reduced zones below.\n\n\n Commerical     Compact    Downtown Residential  University \n        969          10          15        1223          11 \n\nThe interactive map shows these collapsed categories for the whole county. Most of the county is zoned residential, which makes sense. Commercial zones mainly follow along the major highway corridor NC 147 and I-40, along with smatterings here and there. The compact zones are relatively concentrated just north of Duke’s main campus. There are a number of condos and apartment buildings, a few hotels even, in that zone.\n\n\n\nCollapsed Zone Density\n\n\n\nMax Dwell Units by Zone\nFollowing the table shown above, the max dwell units by zone type are shown. University zones are removed for simplicity.\n\n\n\nThe units/acre map doesn’t show too much information, outside of East Durham is likely due for some expanded zoning restrictions. What I find interesting is the collapsed zone density map, the little pockets of high density in Trinity Park, where I walk my dog several times a day and fight the urge to not just allow but actively encourage Charlie the Greyhound to pee on the quarter million dollar McMansion sprouting up between the duplexes and triplexes which are clearly fit in those little pockets of high density zoned plots.\nI’m also kidding, Charlie is far too polite of a pup, and I am not one of those monster dog owners.\nWhat may help illuminate this is to see how many people are living in these type of zones.\nHeaping Cup of Demographic Data\nThe question we want to answer: how many people and households reside in the variety of zones, and how has that changed? Are zones meeting the explosion of demand in Durham?\nUsing the 2020 and 2010 census data, with some geospatial data science stacks, we can tag each residential zone type with the sum of households and total population represented.\nThe first two graphs show these results. The majority of the population in Durham County lives in low density zones, nearly a third of the total population. Downtown and Compact combined represented 11,000 population in 2020, which more than doubled compared to 2010. Households follow a similar trend.\n\n\n\n\nThe second set of graphs show the percent increase from 2010 to 2020 for each zone. Compact and Downtown saw a dramatically higher increase. These are encouraging results for these newer designed zones. But these graphs also show how supply is matched with demand in a manner. The Downtown zones saw a dramatic increase, almost twice the growth in supply compared to demand. This doesn’t immediately suggest that there is a glut of downtown households available, as the supply very well may have been rushing to meet existing, previous demand.\n\n\n\nNIMBY Score\nWorking on this section…..\nLet’s develop a super simple quantitative measure for NIMBY-ism.\nLet’s tag each zone in Durham with the population and households within the respective zone. We will then be able to see how housing supply changed from 2010 to 2020.\nMap new NIMBY score, which is just standardized HH_Growth from 0 - 1\nto do -\npick up where i left on 1.18.22 - the map is close, but may be useful to collapse the difference b/w the HHs and the HH’s zoned by category\nReferences\nhttps://medium.com/@NYUurbanlab/actually-nimbys-cities-arent-building-enough-51806be038ae\nhttps://abundanthousingla.org/meet-l-a-countys-biggest-nimbys/\nhttps://live-durhamnc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/zoning/explore?location=36.012451%2C-78.920767%2C15.62\nhttps://maps.durhamnc.gov/?x=36.01483037908998&y=-78.92072715568013&z=18055.9548215&r=0&b=11&pid=NA&s=zoning&l=active_address_points,countymask,transitionalofficeoverlay,NPO,NHD,LocHistLandmarks,airportoverlay,citylimits,RTPboundary,parcels,zoning,\n\n\n\n",
