## About


My name is Jake Ford, I live in Toronto, Canada (moving back to Durham in Summer 2025!). I'm a Data Scientist for [Solstice](https://solstice.us/), working to democratize access to solar energy. Previously, I've worked in policy analysis and transportation modeling at the state and local government level.

My interests include travel, food, their very important combination in addition to writing about policy related questions in a data science framework; along with books I'm reading, podcasts I'm listening to, how NIMBY-ism stifles progress and innovation. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's serious, hopefully more often than not it's both! 


Here's charlie, our rescue greyhound. You'll probably be seeing him a lot here. Look at that snoot!
